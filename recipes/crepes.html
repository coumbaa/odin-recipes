        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This simple but delicious crepe recipe can be made in minutes from ingredients that everyone has on hand. Crepes are very thin pancakes. They can be served with a wide variety of sweet and savory fillings and toppings. You'll find a step-by-step recipe below!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Add flour and butter and whisk vigorously until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high head. Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe.</li>
            <li>Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
            <li>Cook until the top of the crepe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crepe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
